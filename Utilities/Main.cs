// This is your shared project

// Shared project can be used as references by adding them in References > Add Reference 
// and clicking "Shared Projects" in the left-hand-side panel

// Unlike normal projects, shared projects can't be built (turned into a DLL) manually
// Shared projects are built automatically when building other projects that require it,
// and the two DLLs are merged
